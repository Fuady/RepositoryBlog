Hi, I'm Angga Fuady. Welcome to my blog!

Currently, I am a PhD student in statistics at [The Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands](https://www.lumc.nl/org/bds/?setlanguage=English&setcountry=en). My research mainly focuses on the development of statistical models to analyze omics data, such as transcriptomics, and glycomics that measured by multiple technologies. Previously, I studied mathematics for my Bachelor's and Master's degree at [Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia](https://www.itb.ac.id/). 

This blog is not intended to contain anything about my research. I will focus on R, Rstudio, and data analysis. With the hype of data analyst and data scientist jobs, hopefully, this blog will be benefit for those who are still in the beginning step of learning R. 

Finally, I hope that writing on this blog can be useful for all readers. Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to read this blog.
